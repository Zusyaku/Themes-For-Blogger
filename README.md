# Themes-Blogger


Using themes to change the look of your blog
When you use one of the Blogger themes, readers can interact and view your blog in a different way.

Choose a theme
1. https://www.blogger.com/
2. Once in the blog dashboard, click the Template menu.
3. Still in the Template menu, scroll your mouse and find a number of template options that have been provided by Blogger.com. This is what I meant in the first paragraph, if you want to use an existing template please hover over one of the templates and click the Apply to Blog option.
4. But if you want to copy your own template or someone else's, look at the top right corner of your computer screen and find the Backup/Restore button or if it's in English Backup/Restore.
5. After you click the button, a popup window will appear as shown below. To continue click the Browse button.
6. You will be asked to select the template file that you downloaded earlier, if you have found it, click the Open button.
7. You will be returned to the popup window earlier, then click the Upload button

#Theme Format File Is XML
